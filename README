About
-----

This module was born for a need to monitor and control Asterisk using POE.
I use this module to collect stats using POE::Component::RRDTool.  I send
timed calls to Asterisk and collect call stats that are then pushed into
RRDTool for graphing in another interface.

See POE::Filter::Asterisk::Manager also

See the individual modules' documentation for more information.

Installation
------------

This package requires the following extra modules from CPAN:

	Digest::MD5 - Used in the authentication process to login to the asterisk manager port.

In addition, you will also need:

	POE::Filter::Asterisk::Manager

You will need a recent version of POE (at least 0.12_03).

The installation process is straightforward:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test
  make install

The Makefile.PL does not take any extra arguments.
