POE::Component::Client::Asterisk::Manager
---------------------------------------------------

About
-----

This module was born for a need to monitor and control Asterisk using POE.
I use this module to collect stats using POE::Component::RRDTool.  I send
timed calls to Asterisk and collect call stats that are then pushed into
RRDTool for graphing in another interface.  I left this code with my last
employer, so don't ask for it. Sorry.

This module should work with Aefirion also.  http://aefirion.org/

See POE::Filter::Asterisk::Manager also.

See the individual modules' documentation for more information.

Installation
------------

This package requires the following extra modules from CPAN:

	Digest::MD5 - Used in the authentication process to login to the asterisk manager port.

You will need a recent version of POE (at least 0.12_03).

The installation process is straightforward:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

The Makefile.PL does not take any extra arguments.
